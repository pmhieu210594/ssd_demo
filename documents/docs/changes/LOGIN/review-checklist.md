## 2. General System Review

### 2.1. Number/Input Check
- OK Clear Numeric Validation: `APP_JWT_EXPIRATION_HOURS` is positive/configured safely.
- OK Full-width Numbers are Processed or Clearly Not Supported: numeric auth policy is config-only, not user input.
- OK Half-width/Full-width Mixed Numbers are Considered: not applicable to login form except username as opaque string.
- OK Empty String/Null are Processed: username, password, bearer token, and auth principal null cases are handled safely.
- OK Clear Digit/Precision/Scale/Rounding: token TTL seconds are interpreted consistently.
- OK No Overflow/Underflow: policy values cannot cause overflow or unusable token TTL.

### 2.2. Character Type / Encoding / Locale

- OK Full-width/half-width/emoji/surrogate pair considered for username input as string data.
- OK Clear trim rule: backend trims username before account lookup.
- OK Unicode normalization if needed: no normalization is added while username case/normalization is open.
- OK No mojibake Shift-JIS/UTF-8 in docs or locale JSON files.
- OK Japanese/Vietnamese/English messages are not misspelled and all user-visible LOGIN strings are localized.

### 2.3. Literal / Magic Number

- OK No hard-coded business code value: token TTL, refresh-token enablement, and Remember Me enablement come from config.
- OK Enum/constant/master used correctly: auth error codes and role values are stable and mapped intentionally.
- OK Clear mapping display/internal value: backend error codes map to safe localized FE messages.

### 2.4. Operation / Maintainability

- OK Sufficient logs for incident investigation without passwords, hashes, tokens, secrets, SQL details, or account-existence hints.
- OK Correlation ID/request ID if needed: `traceId` is preserved for API errors/log lookup.
- OK Retry/double execution considered: login double submit is prevented and logout remains safe on API failure.
- OK Clear rollback/manual recovery: `/api/v1/me` compatibility and DB immutability are preserved.
- OK Configuration not hard-coded: JWT secret and auth policy are runtime configuration.

## 3. FE Review

- OK `EDCAP_FE/src/pages/LoginPage.tsx` uses username/password as the primary login path.
- OK Login page does not expose active OAuth/SSO/register/password-reset/MFA/Remember Me/refresh-flow UI.
- OK Login submit uses `endpoints.authLogin()` from `src/lib/api.ts`, not `C_API.Login` or `src/utils/api.ts`.
- OK Button is disabled when username/password is missing and while mutation is pending.
- OK Password input is masked by default and visibility toggle remains accessible.
- OK 401 auth errors are localized through safe message keys.
- OK Success stores current auth state according to current implementation and redirects using `/:lang` + `redirectTo`.
- OK `useAuth()` treats current-user 401 as anonymous.
- OK `logout()` calls `authLogout()`, clears local access/refresh token state, clears `["me"]`, and redirects to login even if API fails.
- OK `App.tsx` guards route anonymous/admin/non-admin behavior without redirect loops.
- OK `Layout.tsx` logout uses `logout()` from `useAuth.ts`.
- OK `public/locales/{en,vi,ja}/locale.json` contains all user-visible LOGIN strings.

## 4. BE/API Review

- OK `POST /api/v1/auth/login` accepts only documented username/password request and validates nonblank/size constraints.
- OK Login response matches FE/BE DTO contract, including `accessToken`, `refreshToken`, `tokenType`, `expiresInSeconds`, `user`, and `redirectTo`.
- OK `POST /api/v1/auth/logout` returns 204 and does not expose token/session internals.
- OK `GET /api/v1/auth/me` is canonical current-user endpoint.
- OK `GET /api/v1/me` remains compatible with `/api/v1/auth/me`.
- OK Protected APIs require valid JWT and active token-session hash.
- OK `AuthController` and `MeController` delegate to application services and do not call infrastructure directly.
- OK `GlobalExceptionHandler` maps auth failures to safe `ErrorResponse` values.
- OK `ErrorResponse` shape remains `timestamp`, `status`, `error`, `message`, `traceId`.

## 5. DB/Migration Review

- OK `tbl_auth_user_account` remains the source for username, hash, algorithm, active flag, and user metadata.
- OK Password verification uses `password_hash` and `password_algo`; raw passwords are not compared in SQL.
- OK Token-session behavior is handled safely.
- OK `tbl_auth_token_session` supports token hashes, active-session validation, and logout revocation.
- OK Existing V4/V5/V6 migrations are not edited in place.
- OK Any new DB change is additive and tied to an approved human decision.
- OK Token/session cleanup gaps are documented if not implemented.

## 6. Security/Privacy Review

- OK Passwords, password hashes, access tokens, refresh tokens, JWT secrets, SQL details, and stack traces are never exposed.
- OK Unknown username and wrong password are indistinguishable to users and API consumers.
- OK Inactive accounts use safe unavailable-account behavior.
- OK Bearer token authentication verifies JWT signature/expiry and active token-session hash.
- OK Logout revocation behavior is verified and any limitations are documented.
- OK Email exposure is checked against HD-LOGIN-003 and not expanded silently.
- OK localStorage token posture is checked against HD-LOGIN-007 and not silently approved for production.
- OK Refresh-token behavior is checked against HD-LOGIN-001 and no refresh rotation is added silently.
- OK `returnUrl` is not implemented unless HD-LOGIN-004 is resolved.

## 7. Operation/Maintenance Review

- OK Runtime config documents JWT secret, TTL, refresh-token flag, and Remember Me flag.
- OK Trace IDs are available for support without secret leakage.
- OK Server/network failure on login shows safe FE fallback and does not leave stale auth.
- OK Token-session table growth/cleanup is documented as follow-up if not implemented.
- OK Support behavior is documented as follow-up if not implemented.
- OK Formal audit logging remains open unless approved.
- OK Stale OAuth/session documentation is not treated as authoritative for LOGIN.

## 8. Test Review

- OK FE unit tests cover login render, required fields, password mask/toggle, loading/double submit, error localization, admin/non-admin redirects, authenticated redirect, and logout local clear.
- OK FE API/helper tests cover bearer header, token set/clear, error parsing, and 401 handling.
- OK BE unit tests cover successful login, username trim, invalid credentials, inactive account, reset on success, token issue/parse/expiry/hash.
- OK BE integration tests cover login validation, login success, `/api/v1/auth/me`, `/api/v1/me`, logout 204, missing/expired/revoked tokens.
- OK E2E tests cover anonymous login, admin login, non-admin login, invalid credential, and logout if in scope.
- OK Black-box tests cover account enumeration, secret leakage, username length boundary, network/server failure, and out-of-scope feature absence.
- OK `test-results.md` records exact commands and results; no PASS is claimed without execution evidence.

## 9. Documentation/Traceability Review

- OK `spec-pack.md`, `context.md`, `impact-analysis.md`, and `impl-plan.md` agree on scope and open issues.
- OK AC mapping is present in `spec-pack.md`, `impl-plan.md`, `review-checklist.md`, `test-plan.md`, and later `self-review.md`.
- OK Source availability and source inventory are current.
- OK Open issues remain visible and are not implemented silently.
- OK Template headings remain aligned with `_ticket-template`.
- OK `.claude/rules` absence is recorded and no missing local rule is assumed.

## 10. Release/Rollback Review

- OK `/api/v1/me` compatibility is preserved during rollout.
- OK Rollback avoids destructive DB changes.
- OK Existing migrations are not modified in place.
- OK Token storage changes, if any, include browser-state cleanup/migration.
- OK Route changes, if any, update FE route guards and E2E expectations together.
- OK Release is blocked or accepted-risk documented for unresolved refresh-token, email exposure, token storage, audit logging, and non-admin landing decisions.
