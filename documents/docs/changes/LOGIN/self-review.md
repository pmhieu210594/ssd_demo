# Self Review

**Ticket ID**: LOGIN  
**Create date**: 2026-06-11  
**Author**: Codex  
**Update date**: 2026-06-11  
## 1. Implementation Summary

Phase 5 reviewed the existing LOGIN implementation against `spec-pack.md`, `context.md`, `ticket-rules.md`, `impact-analysis.md`, `impl-plan.md`, and `review-checklist.md`. No additional code change was required in this turn; the implementation already exists in the FE/BE working tree and was verified with targeted tests and FE build.

| item | status | note |
|---|---|---|
| FE implementation | Reviewed | `LoginPage.tsx`, `useAuth.ts`, `lib/api.ts`, `App.tsx`, and `Layout.tsx` cover credential login, token persistence, `/auth/me`, logout, redirects, and guarded routes. |
| BE implementation | Reviewed | `AuthController`, `MeController`, `AuthService`, `AuthTokenService`, bearer filter, DTOs, exception handler, security config, migrations, and tests cover the LOGIN MVP flow. |
| DB/migration | Reviewed | Additive migrations for token sessions are present in BE. No extra migration was added in this turn. |
| Tests | PASS | Targeted FE Vitest, BE Maven tests, and FE build/typecheck passed after sandbox escalation where required. |
| Documentation | Updated | This `self-review.md` was completed for independent review handoff. |

## 2. Specification/AC Matching
| AC ID | status | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | Reviewed | Login page renders username/password form and submit controls in `LoginPage.tsx`; FE auth tests passed. |
| AC-2 | Reviewed | Username is required in FE submit gating and BE DTO/service validation. |
| AC-3 | Reviewed | Password is required in FE submit gating and BE DTO/service validation. |
| AC-4 | Reviewed | Password input uses masked type by default and has explicit show/hide toggle in `LoginPage.tsx`. |
| AC-5 | Reviewed | FE disables submit while pending and missing required values. |
| AC-6 | Verified | BE login response includes access token, refresh token, token type, expiry, user, and redirect; `AuthApiIntegrationTest` passed. |
| AC-7 | Verified | `AuthService.login` trims username before lookup; `AuthServiceTest` passed. |
| AC-8 | Verified | Invalid credentials return uniform `INVALID_CREDENTIALS`; targeted BE tests passed. |
| AC-9 | Verified | Inactive account path returns temporary unavailable behavior; `AuthServiceTest` passed. |
| AC-10 | Verified | Repeated failed logins remain generic and safe; `AuthServiceTest` passed. |
| AC-11 | Verified | Successful login revokes/replaces prior active token session; `AuthServiceTest` passed. |
| AC-12 | Reviewed | Admin login response redirects to `/admin`; FE applies localized redirect. |
| AC-13 | Reviewed | Non-admin login response redirects to `/`; product still must confirm whether `/home` is desired. |
| AC-14 | Reviewed | Authenticated users visiting login are redirected based on role in `LoginPage.tsx`. |
| AC-15 | Verified | Bearer token validation checks signature, expiry, and active token session; `AuthTokenServiceTest` and API integration tests passed. |
| AC-16 | Verified | `/api/v1/auth/me` and `/api/v1/me` are both mapped and tested. |
| AC-17 | Verified | Logout returns 204 and invokes server-side revoke path; `AuthApiIntegrationTest` passed. |
| AC-18 | Reviewed | FE logout clears access token/cache and navigates to localized login in `useAuth.ts`. |
| AC-19 | Reviewed | No password/secret logging observed in reviewed LOGIN code; generic auth error codes are used. |
| AC-20 | Reviewed | No refresh-token flow, password reset, registration, or OAuth implementation was added in this turn. |

## 3. List of Changed Files
| file | summary | reason |
|---|---|---|
| `documents/docs/changes/LOGIN/self-review.md` | Completed Phase 5 self review with actual verification evidence. | Prepare handoff to independent review and human review. |
| Code files | No additional code file changed in this turn. | Existing implementation already matched the Phase 5 scope sufficiently for targeted verification. |

## 4. Runn Command and Results
| command | result | note |
|---|---|---|
| `npx vitest run src/__tests__/auth src/__tests__/lib/api.test.ts --reporter=dot` | PASS | 3 test files, 14 tests passed. Initial sandbox run failed to load Vite config; escalated retry passed. |
| `mvn test '-Dtest=AuthServiceTest,AuthTokenServiceTest,AuthApiIntegrationTest'` | PASS | 13 BE tests passed. Initial sandbox run could not access Maven Central; escalated retry passed. |
| `npm run -s build` | PASS | FE `tsc && vite build` completed; 3259 modules transformed. Initial sandbox run failed to load Vite config; escalated retry passed. |

## 5. Self-Check using Review Checklist
| checklist area | result | note |
|---|---|---|
| Specification/AC Matching | PASS | AC table above is mapped to reviewed files and test evidence. |
| General System Review | PASS | Scope remained limited to LOGIN; no broad refactor was added. |
| FE Review | PASS | Login, token storage, `/auth/me`, guarded route, logout, and redirect paths reviewed. |
| BE/API Review | PASS | Auth endpoints, DTOs, token validation, session revoke, and error mapping reviewed and tested. |
| DB/Migration Review | PASS | Additive auth/session migrations present; no destructive migration found in reviewed scope. |
| Security/Privacy Review | REVIEW_REQUIRED | Token storage, refresh-token response, email-in-token, and audit policy still require human/security confirmation. |
| Operation/Maintenance Review | REVIEW_REQUIRED | Token cleanup and audit/log policy remain product/ops decisions. |
| Test Review | PASS_WITH_GAPS | Targeted FE/BE/build passed; Playwright/E2E and manual black-box execution were not run in this turn. |
| Documentation/Traceability Review | PASS | Phase 5 evidence added to this file using the ticket template headings. |
| Release/Rollback Review | REVIEW_REQUIRED | Rollback is documented in impl plan; production rollout needs human sign-off on pending policy items. |

## 6. Test Plan Corresponding Status

| test area | planned evidence | status | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| FE unit/component | LoginPage, useAuth/logout, API helper tests | PASS | `npx vitest run src/__tests__/auth src/__tests__/lib/api.test.ts --reporter=dot`: 14 tests passed. |
| FE build/typecheck | FE build command | PASS | `npm run -s build` passed. |
| BE unit | AuthService and AuthTokenService tests | PASS | Included in targeted Maven run. |
| BE integration | AuthApiIntegrationTest and protected token paths | PASS | Included in targeted Maven run. |
| E2E | Playwright login journeys | NOT_RUN | Not executed in this turn; keep for QA/independent review if environment is available. |
| Black-box | Enumeration, leakage, boundary, network failure | PARTIAL | Covered by source review and unit/integration tests; full manual black-box execution remains pending. |

## 7. Bugs Found and Resolved
| bug | cause | fix | test |
|---|---|---|---|
| None found in this turn | Reviewed implementation already covered planned LOGIN scope | No code fix applied | Targeted FE tests, BE tests, and FE build passed |

## 8. Unprocessed / Pending / Accepted Risk

| item | reason | impact | owner | deadline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| HD-LOGIN-001 refresh-token MVP policy | Current response/storage includes refresh token while refresh flow is disabled. | Contract/security ambiguity. | Product/Architecture/Security | Before release freeze |
| HD-LOGIN-002 non-admin landing route | Current route is `/:lang/`; `/home` not confirmed. | Route and E2E expectations may change. | Product/UX | Before release freeze |
| HD-LOGIN-003 email exposure | Email is currently in auth payload/JWT. | Privacy/API ambiguity. | Product/Security | Before release freeze |
| HD-LOGIN-004 `returnUrl` | Requirement exists in raw docs but behavior/allowlist not confirmed. | UX and open-redirect risk. | Product/Security | Before implementation if selected |
| HD-LOGIN-005 username case-sensitivity | Current behavior should not be changed silently. | DB/query/user-support ambiguity. | Product/BE | Before implementation if touched |
| HD-LOGIN-006 audit logging | Formal audit is not in MVP. | Compliance/operation ambiguity. | Product/Security/Ops | Before release freeze |
| HD-LOGIN-007 token storage posture | Current FE localStorage storage needs production security review. | XSS/token theft risk. | Security/FE | Before production |
| OI-LOGIN-008 documentation drift | Root and FE LOGIN docs can diverge. | Future implementer may read stale source. | Documentation owner | Before next LOGIN update |
| QA-LOGIN-001 E2E not run | Playwright journeys were not executed in this turn. | Browser-level regression risk remains. | QA/FE | Before release candidate |

## 9. AI-generated predictions

- Refresh-token and token-storage policy are the most likely security review blockers.
- Non-admin landing route may change E2E expected URLs if product chooses `/home`.
- Email exposure may require DTO/JWT/test updates if privacy policy restricts it.
- Logout being `permitAll` in security config is compatible with graceful client logout, but should be explicitly accepted by security reviewers.
- Stale OAuth/session documentation may continue to confuse implementation unless marked historical or synchronized.
