# Final Report

**Ticket ID**: LOGIN  
**Create date**: 2026-06-11  
**Author**: Codex  
**Update date**: 2026-06-11  

## 1. Edited summary

LOGIN now has a complete ticket package from investigation through final report. The package defines the username/password bearer-token MVP as the canonical spec, maps AC-1 to AC-20 to implementation and tests, records impact across FE/BE/API/DB/security/operation, adds focused test coverage for Phase 6 gaps, and prepares black-box/manual review material for Phase 7.

Production source changes were not added in Phase 5 because the current working tree already contained the LOGIN implementation. Phase 6 added focused test code only. Phase 7 and Phase 8 updated documentation artifacts only.

## 2. Corresponding specification / AC
| ACID | status | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-1 | Covered | Login page/render evidence in FE tests and Playwright login spec. |
| AC-2 | Covered | Empty username behavior covered by FE test plan and LoginPage required-field tests. |
| AC-3 | Covered | Empty password behavior covered by FE test plan and LoginPage required-field tests. |
| AC-4 | Covered | Phase 6 added password mask/toggle test. |
| AC-5 | Covered | Phase 6 added pending submit duplicate-protection test. |
| AC-6 | Covered | BE login response covered by `AuthApiIntegrationTest`; admin/non-admin E2E login passed. |
| AC-7 | Covered | Username trim covered by `AuthServiceTest`; boundary cases documented in black-box plan. |
| AC-8 | Covered | Invalid credential behavior covered by FE/BE tests and Playwright invalid-login case. |

| AC-20 | Partially covered | Out-of-scope features documented and black-box cases prepared; human policy decisions remain open. |

## 3. Scope of influence

- FE: `LoginPage`, `useAuth`, API helper, routing/guards, layout logout, locale strings, auth/unit/E2E tests.
- BE: login/logout/current-user controllers, auth service, token service, bearer filter, security config, DTOs, exception handling, auth persistence/mappers, migrations V4/V5/V6, BE auth tests.
- API contract: `POST /api/v1/auth/login`, `POST /api/v1/auth/logout`, `GET /api/v1/auth/me`, compatibility `GET /api/v1/me`, bearer protected API behavior.
- DB: `tbl_auth_user_account`, `tbl_auth_token_session`; no migration edited in this phase.
- Operation/security: token storage, refresh-token policy, email exposure, audit/unlock/cleanup, trace/log redaction, black-box release review.

|---|---|---|
| Self Review | READY_FOR_INDEPENDENT_REVIEW_WITH_HUMAN_DECISIONS | Phase 5 self-review completed; security/operation decisions still pending. |
| Independent AI Review | PARTIAL | Existing `codex-review.md` passed documentation merge only; no separate full code review was performed after Phase 6 test additions. |
| Human Review | PENDING | `human-review.md` has no reviewer verdict; release-sensitive decisions remain unresolved. |

## 6. Test results
| test type | result | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| FE unit/component | PASS | `npx vitest run src/__tests__/auth src/__tests__/lib/api.test.ts --reporter=dot`: 3 files, 17 tests passed. |
| BE unit/integration | PASS | `mvn test '-Dtest=AuthServiceTest,AuthTokenServiceTest,AuthApiIntegrationTest'`: 15 tests passed. |
| FE build/typecheck | PASS | `npm run -s build`: Vite build succeeded, 3259 modules transformed. |
| E2E | PASS | `npx playwright test e2e_tests/tests/login.spec.ts --reporter=line`: 3 mocked login journeys passed. |
| Black-box/manual | PLANNED | 32 cases and checklist prepared; manual/QA execution not performed in Phase 7/8. |

## 7. Security / operations perspective

Security-critical behavior is covered by targeted tests for generic credential errors, token expiry/tamper rejection, no-token 401, logout clear, and repeated-failure safety. Remaining release risk is policy/operation oriented: refresh-token response while refresh flow is disabled, localStorage token posture, email in auth payload/JWT, formal audit logging, token-session cleanup, and full real revoked-token/server-session E2E.

Operations must ensure runtime JWT secret and auth policy values are configured safely. Logs and trace evidence must not include passwords, hashes, raw access tokens, raw refresh tokens, SQL details, or stack traces with secrets.

## 8. Accepted Risk
| risk | impact | owner | deadline | approver |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Refresh token returned/stored while active refresh flow is disabled | Contract/security ambiguity | Product/Architecture/Security | Before release freeze | Pending |
| Access/refresh token storage in localStorage | XSS/token theft risk | Security/FE | Before production | Pending |
| Email exposed in auth response/JWT | Privacy/API ambiguity | Product/Security | Before release freeze | Pending |
| Non-admin route `/:lang/` may change to `/home` | Route/E2E churn | Product/UX | Before release freeze | Pending |
| `returnUrl` not implemented | UX/security open redirect design deferred | Product/Security | Before adding return flow | Pending |
| Username case-sensitivity not finalized | DB/support ambiguity | Product/BE | Before changing lookup behavior | Pending |
| Audit/unlock/token cleanup not specified | Operation/compliance gap | Product/Security/Ops | Before production rollout | Pending |
| Full real revoked-token and DB-backed repeated-failure E2E not run | Integration drift risk | QA/BE/FE | Before release candidate | Pending |

## 9. Open Issues
| issue | impact | next action |
|---|---|---|
| OI-LOGIN-001 refresh-token MVP policy | FE/BE/security contract may change | Human decision; update DTO/tests/docs if changed. |
| OI-LOGIN-002 non-admin landing route | E2E and routing expectations may change | Product/UX decision. |
| OI-LOGIN-003 email exposure | Privacy/API payload may change | Product/security decision. |
| OI-LOGIN-004 `returnUrl` | UX and open-redirect risk | Decide scope and allowlist before implementation. |
| OI-LOGIN-005 username case-sensitivity | Query/data behavior ambiguity | Decide before changing lookup/normalization. |
| OI-LOGIN-006 audit logging | Operation/compliance ambiguity | Decide required audit events and retention. |
| OI-LOGIN-007 localStorage token persistence | Production security ambiguity | Security review and approval/change request. |
| OI-LOGIN-008 documentation drift | Future stale-source risk | Select canonical folder or sync policy. |

## 10. Human Decisions

|---|---|---|
| Keep/remove/defer refresh-token field in MVP | Product/Architecture/Security | Pending |
| Keep `/:lang/` as non-admin landing or add `/home` | Product/UX | Pending |
| Permit `email` in auth responses and JWT | Product/Security | Pending |
| Implement `returnUrl` and allowlist | Product/Security | Pending |
| Username matching case-sensitive or case-insensitive | Product/BE | Pending |
| Formal login audit, unlock, cleanup requirements | Product/Security/Ops | Pending |
| localStorage token persistence acceptable for production | Security/FE | Pending |
| Logout endpoint `permitAll` acceptable | Security/Architecture | Pending |

## 11. Source Analysis Limitations

- `EDCAP_FE/.claude/rules` was not present in the readable workspace.
- No meeting memo, PR comments, CI result, or final human review verdict was supplied.
- Existing working tree had many pre-existing FE/BE LOGIN changes; this report does not claim authorship of those production changes.
- Phase 6 tests were targeted, not full repository suites.
- Playwright E2E used mocked auth API, not a real BE/database login flow.
- Manual black-box/security/operation review cases were prepared but not executed.
- Some terminal output previously showed encoding mojibake; headings were rechecked against templates after edits.

## 12. What worked

- Template-heading checks caught drift in multiple artifacts before finalizing.
- Small Phase 6 tests closed real AC gaps without touching production code.
- Targeted FE, BE, build, and Playwright commands all passed after using required sandbox escalation.
- Keeping open decisions in the docs prevented accidental implementation of refresh flow, `/home`, `returnUrl`, audit, or token-storage redesign.
- The AC to test and AC to black-box mapping gives future reviewers a practical trail.

## 13. What failed

- Earlier report/test artifacts were stale after later phases and needed Phase 8 refresh.
- Sandbox blocked Vite config loading and Maven dependency/network access until commands were rerun with approved escalation.
- The independent review artifact only covered documentation merge, not the final code/test state.
- Human review and release policy decisions are still unavailable.
- Black-box/manual cases are prepared but not executed.

## 14. Candidate updates Failure Mode Index

- Auth docs drift: root and FE change packages diverge and future implementers read stale source.
- Account enumeration: unknown username and wrong password expose different UI/API behavior.
- Secret leakage: raw password/hash/token/JWT secret appears in UI/API/log/test artifact.
- Refresh-token ambiguity: refresh token is returned/stored while refresh flow is disabled.
- Token revocation mismatch: logout appears successful but old access token remains accepted.
- Auth route drift: stale OAuth/session route or old `/api/v1/login` path bypasses current spec.
- Sandbox false failure: Vite/Maven commands fail due environment restriction and are mistaken for product regressions.
- Encoding drift: Unicode headings or locale text become mojibake and break template checks or UI review.

## 15. Candidate updates Living Docs

- LOGIN API contract: request/response/error codes for login/logout/current-user.
- Bearer auth flow: FE token storage, Authorization header, current-user lookup, bearer filter, token session validation.
- Auth account-state policy: reset behavior and helpdesk unlock gap.
- Safe auth error mapping: generic invalid credentials, unavailable account, validation, unauthorized.
- Test playbook for auth tickets: FE Vitest, BE Maven targeted tests, FE build, mocked Playwright login.
- Security decision record: refresh-token policy, localStorage posture, email exposure, logout permit policy.
- Documentation source-of-truth rule for `docs/changes/{{TICKET}}` packages.

## 16. Final Verdict

- NEEDS_UPDATE before production release: implementation and targeted tests are ready for independent review, but human/security/operation decisions and manual black-box review remain pending.
