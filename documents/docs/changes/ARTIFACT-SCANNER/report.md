## 1. Edited Summary

Implemented the Artifact Scanner as a backend metadata-only inventory component on V4: scanner service, V4 persistence/view, API/manual verification surface, black-box coverage, and final review/test closure.

## 2. Corresponding Specification / AC

| ACID | status | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-ARTIFACT-SCANNER-01 | DONE | `blackbox-testcases.md` and BE tests cover ticket-scoped scanning of `docs/changes/<TICKET>/` |

## 3. Scope of Influence

- BE scanner orchestration/usecase/persistence/API
- DB migration/view/seed for the V4 scanner read/write model
- API/manual test and documentation artifacts for review/operation
- Review/test evidence and promotion-candidate docs
- Does not include parser details, Git/PR/CI collectors, KPI, or traceability

| BE UT | PASS | `mvn test -Dtest=ArtifactScannerServiceTest,GithubWebhookServiceTest` |
| API IT | PASS | Backend integration/static verification passed according to `test-results.md` |

| Black-box | PASS | `BB-ARTIFACT-SCANNER-01` to `BB-ARTIFACT-SCANNER-12` all passed |

## 7. Security / Operations Perspective

- Scanner does not store full Markdown content.
- Logs do not contain secrets, tokens, or raw content.
- Unknown ticket paths auto-create a minimal ticket and continue scanning.
- Current inventory is read from the `vw_artifact_inventory_current` view; no new physical inventory table is created.
- The API/manual surface only serves testing/operation needs and does not expand the scanner into a UI-first feature.

## 8. Accepted Risk

| risk | impact | owner | deadline | approver |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Live end-to-end webhook verification on an externally hosted repo | External verification is still needed in a real deployment environment | Implementation owner | Before production rollout | Human reviewer |
| Repository mapping consistency between source naming and scanner lookup | Scan may miss the source if seed/mapping drifts | Implementation owner | Before release | Human reviewer |

## 9. Open Issues

| issue | impact | next action |
|---|---|---|
| No open blocker remains in the final state | None | Keep as reference only for future scanner phases |

## 10. Human Decisions

| decision | owner | result |
|---|---|---|
| Snapshot columns | Human | `size_bytes`, `scan_status`, `scan_message`, `need_parse` |
| Unknown ticket policy | Human | `auto-create minimal ticket` |
| Current inventory | Human | `vw_artifact_inventory_current` |
| Test access | Human | API/manual query |
| Phase0 seed | Human | Implemented in this ticket |
| `CHANGED_FILES_SCOPED` in MVP | Human | Not prioritized for MVP v1 |
| `blackbox-testcases.md` | Human | Mandatory scanner target |
| Final review verdict | Human | APPROVED |

## 11. Source Analysis Limitations

- The codebase still contains legacy source, but this ticket intentionally uses V4-only tables as the design baseline.
- The scanner boundary relies on source metadata and repository layout; if the upstream layout drifts, mapping may need to be refreshed in the future.
- The API/manual test surface is intentionally minimal and only covers review/operation needs.

## 12. What Worked

- The scanner boundary, V4-only persistence, and current inventory view were aligned early.
- Black-box cases and review artifacts provided a consistent evidence chain.
- Self review, independent review, and human review all converged on the same final state.

## 13. What Failed

- Early drafts had stale scope notes, but the final ticket set is now consistent.
- The main residual risk is future drift if the source layout or seed data changes without updating the living docs.

## 14. Candidate Updates for Failure Mode Index

- Scanner boundary drift into parser behavior
- Unknown ticket causing a hard failure
- Accidental reuse of legacy tables
- Current inventory query inconsistency
- Phase0 seed or artifact-type mapping drift

## 15. Candidate Updates for Living Docs

- `docs/architecture/route-api-map.md` for scanner endpoints and manual operation flow
- `docs/architecture/repository-db-map.md` for the V4 scanner adapter and current inventory view
- `docs/architecture/test-map.md` for scanner unit/integration/black-box coverage
- `docs/standards/security.md` if scanner operation guidance needs an explicit metadata-only reminder

## 16. Final Verdict

- DONE
