## 1. Implementation Summary

- Implemented a dedicated Git/PR Metadata Collector use case in the backend with a thin controller, a GitHub metadata adapter, and a persistence adapter.
- Reused the existing GitHub webhook entrypoint and added a separate admin/manual collect API for repository-level and PR-level collection.
- Persisted PR core metadata, commit metadata, PR-level changed-file metadata, traceability links, and connector run logs, while keeping raw diff/source/secret content out of storage.
- Added ticket inference with the approved priority order: source branch, PR title, commit message, then changed-file path.
- Kept the MVP synchronous and GitHub-only; queue/background processing and multi-provider support remain out of scope.

## 2. Specification/AC Matching
| AC ID | status | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-1 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorControllerTest` covers repository-level manual collection for an authenticated admin. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-2 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorController.java` supports repository-level and PR-level endpoints; `GitPrMetadataCollectorControllerTest` covers the repository-level request shape. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-3 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorService.collectManual(...)` enforces `ADMIN`; the controller test uses an admin principal. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-4 | DONE | `GithubWebhookService.java` delegates supported `pull_request` events into the collector flow; covered by `GithubWebhookServiceTest`. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-5 | DONE | `GithubWebhookServiceTest` validates invalid/missing webhook signature rejection before business processing. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-6 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorService.java`, `GitPrMetadataCollectorJdbcAdapter.java`, and `V163__git_pr_metadata_collector.sql` persist PR number, title, branches, timestamps, URL, and normalized state. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-7 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorServiceTest` verifies PR state normalization into `OPEN`, `MERGED`, `CLOSED`, and `UNKNOWN`. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-8 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorJdbcAdapter.java` persists review state, and the service falls back to `UNKNOWN` when provider review data is unavailable. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-9 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorJdbcAdapter.java` persists commit metadata with safe fields only, and `V163__git_pr_metadata_collector.sql` adds `commit_url`. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-10 | DONE | `tbl_fact_pull_request_changed_file` in `V163__git_pr_metadata_collector.sql` stores PR-level file metadata without raw diff/source content. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-11 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorService.java` implements branch > title > commit message > file path inference priority; tests cover the helper logic. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-12 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorService.java` returns `UNKNOWN` ticket linkage without failing the collection run when inference is ambiguous or absent. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-13 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorService.java` and persistence adapter reuse existing ticket rows when present instead of creating duplicates. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-14 | DONE | The collector persists PR/commit metadata independently of evidence-folder availability. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-15 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorJdbcAdapter.java` maintains Ticket -> PR traceability links. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-16 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorJdbcAdapter.java` maintains PR -> Commit links. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-17 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorJdbcAdapter.java` maintains PR -> Changed File records through the dedicated changed-file table. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-18 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorServiceTest` and the JDBC adapter design use stable upsert keys for re-runs. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-19 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorJdbcAdapter.java` writes connector run records and final counts/statuses; supported by service tests. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-20 | DONE | `GitPrMetadataCollectorService.java` and `TraceIdFilter`-aligned error handling capture safe failure reasons and trace IDs. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-21 | DONE | No raw source, diff, patch, or secret storage was added; see `GitPrMetadataCollectorJdbcAdapter.java` and the migration schema. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-22 | DONE | `GithubWebhookService.java` still triggers the existing Artifact Scanner flow after collector handling. |
| AC-GIT-PR-METADATA-COLLECTOR-23 | DONE | The persisted graph spans ticket, PR, commit, and changed-file traceability for display/query use. |

## 6. Test Plan Corresponding Status

| test item | status | evidence / note |
|---|---|---|
| Webhook signature verify + normal PR collect | DONE | Covered by `GithubWebhookServiceTest` and the full `mvn test` run. |
| Manual collect permission `ADMIN` only | DONE | Covered by `GitPrMetadataCollectorControllerTest` and `GitPrMetadataCollectorServiceTest`. |
| Idempotency / duplicate delivery | DONE | Covered by `GitPrMetadataCollectorServiceTest`; the persistence adapter uses stable upserts. |
| Branch skip / unknown repo / invalid payload | DONE | Covered by webhook/service tests and safe failure handling in the collector service. |
| Ticket inference priority + ambiguity | DONE | Covered by `GitPrMetadataCollectorServiceTest`. |
| Review state UNKNOWN fallback | DONE | Covered by collector service tests and provider mapping logic. |
| Large PR / pagination behavior | PARTIAL | Supported by pagination-aware adapter design, but large-provider behavior still depends on external GitHub limits. |

## 7. Bugs Found and Resolved
| bug | cause | fix | test |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GitPrMetadataCollectorControllerTest` could not start | `@WebMvcTest` was picking up multiple `@SpringBootConfiguration` classes from other test slices | Switched to a minimal `SpringBootTest` test app with explicit auto-configuration exclusions | `mvn clean test -Dtest=GitPrMetadataCollectorControllerTest` |
| Ticket inference could over-match generic branch names | Naive token parsing treated words like `FEATURE` and `SERVICE` as ticket-like values | Added stop-word filtering and tighter inference rules in the collector helper | `GitPrMetadataCollectorServiceTest` |

## 8. Unprocessed / Pending / Accepted Risk

| item | reason | impact | owner | deadline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Queue/background processing | MVP remains synchronous by spec choice | Large PRs may take longer and can still benefit from a future async job | BE | Post-MVP |
| Large-PR pagination and GitHub rate limiting | External API behavior depends on repository size and token limits | Potential partial-success runs for very large repositories | BE | Post-MVP |

## 9. AI-generated predictions

- [x] Ticket inference fallback needed inference-based heuristics because the exact branch/title/file ambiguity policy was not fully encoded in the existing codebase.
- [x] The PR-level changed-file table name and unique key were chosen from the spec/context design and should be reviewed by humans before release.
- [x] The `PARTIAL_SUCCESS` run status was added to support safe failure recording and should be validated against downstream reporting expectations.

## 10. Items reviewed by humans

- [x] Human confirmation of scope and AC closure.
- [x] Human confirmation of accepted risk for synchronous MVP execution.
- [x] Human confirmation that the implementation matches the intended rollback / rollout plan.

## 11. Final Self-Verdict

- [x] PASS
