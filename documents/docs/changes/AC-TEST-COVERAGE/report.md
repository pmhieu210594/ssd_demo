# Final Report

**Ticket ID**: AC-TEST-COVERAGE
**Create date**: 2026-06-26  
**Author**: OpenAI
**Update date**: 2026-06-29  

## 1. Edited summary

Phase 8 closed the AC-Test Coverage ticket with a targeted BE regression slice, final documentation pack updates, and final reporting artifacts. The repo now captures canonical AC extraction, planned coverage parsing, executed evidence parsing, the executed-coverage adapter capability, score/read-model linkage, warning persistence, and the black-box contract for AC-first coverage display. The executed-coverage write step is verified at the adapter level, while the full parser-to-read-model invocation remains a later integration concern.

## 2. Corresponding specification / AC
| ACID | status | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| AC-AC-TEST-COVERAGE-1 | PASS | `spec-pack.md` remains the canonical AC source and stable AC keys are validated by parser and black-box cases. |
| AC-AC-TEST-COVERAGE-2 | PASS | Planned coverage is derived from `test-plan.md` and unknown references are surfaced rather than accepted. |
| AC-AC-TEST-COVERAGE-3 | PASS | Missing planned coverage is surfaced as `MISSING` and persisted as a warning / data-quality signal. |
| AC-AC-TEST-COVERAGE-4 | PASS | Planned coverage with no execution evidence is surfaced as `UNTESTED`. |
| AC-AC-TEST-COVERAGE-5 | PASS | Partial many-to-many coverage is preserved and reported as `PARTIAL`. |
| AC-AC-TEST-COVERAGE-6 | PASS | Conflicting pass/fail evidence resolves to `FAILED`, and the targeted slice passed. |
| AC-AC-TEST-COVERAGE-7 | PASS WITH NOTE | `AC -> test cases` and the read-model counts exclude `PLANNED`; the end-to-end parser-to-read-model invocation still needs later integration confirmation. |
| AC-AC-TEST-COVERAGE-8 | PASS | `First CI Pass` and `Exception` remain supporting KPI signals, not coverage overrides. |
| AC-AC-TEST-COVERAGE-9 | PASS | Manual mapping / pinning is rejected; the feature remains parser-only. |
| AC-AC-TEST-COVERAGE-10 | PASS | Warnings and data-quality issues remain visible and auditable. |

## 3. Scope of influence

- Backend parse flow for `test-plan.md` and `test-results.md`.
- Coverage validation and warning persistence.
- Evidence persistence and executed-coverage adapter behavior.
- Evidence-quality score read model.
- Test and review documentation for Phase 8 closure.
- No FE recomputation or manual mapping workflow was introduced.

## 5. Review results

| review type | result | notes |
|---|---|---|
| Self Review | PASS | Self-review completed against the implemented code and the Phase 8 artifact set. |
| Independent AI Review | PASS WITH NOTE | The validation-semantics concern is documented as a limitation rather than a blocker for this closure, and the adapter path is verified. |

## 6. Test results
| test type | result | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Unit / targeted BE regression slice | PASS | `mvn -q -Dtest=TestCoverageValidationServiceTest,TestPlanParseServiceTest,TestResultsParseServiceTest,TestEvidenceJdbcAdapterTest,EvidenceQualityScoreRepositoryAdapterTest,EvidenceQualityScoreServiceTest,ArtifactScannerServiceTest,SpecPackMarkdownParserTest test` |
| Runtime backend | PASS | `Tests run: 298, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0` |
| Runtime frontend | NOT RUN | Out of scope for this phase. |
| Black-box execution | NOT RUN | Black-box cases are recorded as design evidence, not executed runtime evidence. |

## 7. Security / operations perspective

The ticket remains metadata-only and parser-only. It does not persist raw prompt/chat content, raw CI logs, or full source text. Warnings and data-quality issues remain visible for operators, and the read-model count logic keeps `PLANNED` separate from executed evidence so that dashboard users do not confuse planned coverage with actual execution.

## 8. Accepted Risk
| risk | impact | owner | deadline | approver |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FE/runtime dashboard verification is not exercised in this backend-only slice | The UI surface is not runtime-proven in this phase | Engineering | Next phase | TBD |
| Parser-to-executed-coverage invocation is not fully exercised end-to-end | The write step is verified at adapter level, but the full parse-to-read-model path is not yet runtime-proven | Engineering | Next integration phase | TBD |
| Coverage-warning semantics for fail-only AC references remain conservative | Some tickets may still show `AC_NOT_COVERED` warnings even when a failed execution row exists | Engineering / Product | Future rule review | Human review |

## 9. Open Issues
| issue | impact | next action |
|---|---|---|
| Whether fail-only AC references should be treated as executed coverage or remain warning-only | Affects warning noise and the final coverage semantics | Confirm in the next rule review |
| Whether parser-to-coverage materialization should be called inline or deferred | Affects the final end-to-end parse contract | Confirm in the next integration review |
| Whether black-box execution should become a required release gate for later tickets | Affects how much runtime evidence is required before promotion | Decide in the testing standard |

## 10. Human Decisions
| decision | owner | result |
|---|---|---|
| Keep AC-Test Coverage parser-only and reuse-first | Product / engineering | Closed |
| Keep manual mapping / pinning out of scope | Product / engineering | Closed |
| Keep `test-results.md` and CI metadata as supporting evidence rather than canonical source | Product / engineering | Closed |
| Keep support KPIs (`First CI Pass`, `Exception`) separate from coverage override logic | Product / engineering | Closed |

## 11. Source Analysis Limitations

This phase used repository sources, targeted BE tests, and the existing review artifacts only. No production data, no external web sources, and no FE runtime execution were used for the closure evidence. Black-box cases were documented and cross-linked, but not executed as runtime evidence in this backend-only slice. The executed-coverage write capability is verified at adapter level, but the parser-to-read-model call path still needs later integration confirmation.

## 12. What worked

- Reuse-first persistence stayed inside the existing fact-table model.
- AC-first grouping remained stable in the read model.
- The targeted regression slice gave fast feedback on coverage parsing, evidence persistence, and read-model linkage.
- Synthetic fixtures kept the test set deterministic and safe.

## 13. What failed

- The phase did not include FE runtime verification.
- Black-box execution was not part of the backend-only slice.
- The end-to-end parser-to-executed-coverage call was not exercised in this backend-only slice.
- Coverage-warning semantics for fail-only AC references still need a policy decision.

## 14. Candidate updates Failure Mode Index

- Executed coverage never materialized into `tbl_fact_ac_test_coverage`.
- `PLANNED` rows accidentally counted as executed coverage.
- Fail-only AC references are treated as not covered and generate warning noise.
- Manual mapping / pinning leaks back into the parser-only flow.
- Raw source text or raw CI logs leak into metadata artifacts.
- KPI signals are mistaken for coverage overrides.
