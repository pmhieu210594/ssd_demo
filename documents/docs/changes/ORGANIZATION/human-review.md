| Treat dedicated audit log as out of scope | Human / Tech Lead | Implemented as accepted risk |
| Non-ADMIN FE access should logout and redirect to `/:lang/login` | Human / PM / FE Lead | Implemented |
| Keep FE translations in `public/locales/{en,ja,vi}/locale.json` | Human / FE Lead | Implemented |

## Final Human Verdict
