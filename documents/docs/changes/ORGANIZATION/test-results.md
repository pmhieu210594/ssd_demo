## 3. Summary of Results

Organization Phase 6 automated test coverage was implemented and executed in this workspace. Backend unit tests, backend controller integration tests, backend migration integration tests, frontend unit tests, and Playwright E2E tests all passed. Black-box execution also completed with 31 executable cases passed and 2 audit/log cases marked N/A.

## 4. List of Passes

| test | result | note |
|---|---|---|
| BE unit tests | PASS | 42/42 passed. Organization service unit coverage passed. |
| BE controller integration tests | PASS | 12/12 passed. REST contract and error mapping passed. |
| BE migration integration tests | PASS | 12/12 passed. Flyway/PostgreSQL migration checks passed. |
| FE unit tests | PASS | 22/22 passed. `App.test.tsx`, `organization-api.test.ts`, `OrganizationPage.test.tsx`, and `lib/utils.test.ts` passed. |
| E2E tests | PASS | 10/10 passed. Playwright Organization UI E2E passed with the ADMIN session cookie. |
| Black-box tests | PASS | 31/33 passed, 2 N/A. Audit/log cases were deferred in this phase. |

## 5. List of Fails

| test | cause | action | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| None | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## 6. Bugs Fixed

| bug | fix | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Missing Organization BE unit coverage | Added Organization service unit tests for search, admin guard, create/update/delete, duplicate checks, and stale version behavior. | `mvn test -Dtest=OrganizationServiceUnitTest` passed. |
| Missing Organization REST integration coverage | Added Organization controller integration tests for list/detail/create/update/delete and error mappings. | `mvn verify "-Dit.test=OrganizationControllerIntegrationTest"` passed. |
| Missing Organization migration coverage | Added Organization migration integration tests for required columns, indexes, version default, and active-scope behavior. | `mvn verify "-Dit.test=OrganizationMigrationIntegrationTest"` passed. |
| Missing Organization FE unit coverage | Added FE API helper, page, app, and utility tests. | Vitest passed. |
| Missing Organization E2E coverage | Added Playwright Organization E2E flows for page smoke, CRUD, stale version, and non-admin redirect. | Playwright passed. |

## 7. Not yet fixed / Pending

- Audit/log black-box cases remain marked N/A in this phase.

## 8. Test cannot be executed and reason

| test/command | reason | risk | alternative evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Black-box audit/log cases | Audit/log verification is out of scope for this phase. | Low for current phase scope; medium if audit/log becomes a release gate. | 31 other black-box cases passed. |

## 9. Remaining risk

- Audit/log coverage is deferred and should be revisited if it becomes part of the release gate.
- If the phase later requires expanded non-happy-path black-box scope, those cases will need a separate execution run.

## 10. Final Test Verdict

- PASS
