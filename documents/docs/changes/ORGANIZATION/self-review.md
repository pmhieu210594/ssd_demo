# Self Review

**Ticket ID**: ORGANIZATION  
**Create date**: 2026-06-10  
**Author**: nk_trung  
**Update date**: 2026-06-10  

## 1. Implementation Summary

Organization Management implementation is complete across BE, FE, and DB migration, with standardized i18n-backed error handling on the FE side so backend message keys are translated before display.

| Item | Content |
|---|---|
| Implemented summary | Added additive V5 migration for `tbl_dim_organization`; implemented Organization domain, port, adapter, mapper, controller, and service; added FE route/nav/page/API helpers; added localized `en/ja/vi` Organization keys; standardized BE 403/409 error handling and FE error translation. |
| Not implemented | FE automated UI tests; DB integration test setup for a real database. |
| Deferred items | FE automated test implementation remains deferred by decision; OI-P3-ORG-007 DB integration test setup remains deferred. |
| Scope deviations | None. The ticket stays within Organization Management only. |
| Final implementation scope | Organization Management only. Customer implementation, connector flows, metric ingestion, and dedicated audit log are out of scope. |

Required summary checklist:

- [x] Organization list/search/filter implemented.
- [x] Organization create/edit implemented.
- [x] Organization soft delete implemented without physical delete.
- [x] ADMIN-only FE/BE access implemented.
- [x] Optimistic locking by `version` implemented.
- [x] i18n keys normalized and added for `en`, `ja`, `vi`.
- [x] DB migration added without renaming/recreating `tbl_dim_organization`.
- [x] No Customer implementation included.
- [x] No dedicated audit log implementation included.

## 7. Bugs Found and Resolved

| bug | cause | fix | test |
|---|---|---|---|
| `name_masked` did not map to `organizationName` automatically | MyBatis camel-case mapping does not convert `name_masked` to `organizationName` | Aliased `name_masked AS organization_name` in `OrganizationMapper.xml` | BE build/test passed |
| Locale JSON had duplicated `Status` keys after merge | New Organization keys were added without consolidating the existing `Status` object | Merged `Invalid` into the existing `Status` object in all three locale files | Locale JSON validation passed |

## 8. Unprocessed / Pending / Accepted Risk

| item | reason | impact | owner | deadline |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OI-P3-ORG-007 DB integration test setup | Deferred from earlier phase | DB verification confidence depends on a later decision | PM/Tech Lead | Test/verification phase |
| FE automated tests deferred | User decision before implementation | Manual/API verification must be stronger until FE tests are added | PM/Tech Lead | Later test phase |
| Browser smoke on Organization page | Not executed in this turn | UI behavior is implemented but not manually verified in a browser | Engineer/Reviewer | Independent review |

## 9. AI-generated predictions

Record any AI inference that was used during implementation and was not directly confirmed by source/spec/human decision.

| ID | AI assumption / inference | Basis | Risk | Need human review? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| AI-ORG-001 | Chose dedicated `OrganizationPage.tsx` and `OrganizationDtos.java`/`OrganizationService` file names to keep the ticket isolated and readable | Existing repo naming patterns (`AdminPage`, `Dtos`, service/adapter split) | Low | No |

## 10. Items reviewed by humans

| ID | area | request / decision | status | note |
|---|---|---|---|---|

| HR-ORG-002 | API contract | Confirm final endpoint/status behavior matches the agreed contract. | Pending | Especially 403/409 and PATCH delete. |
| HR-ORG-003 | Security | Review ADMIN-only enforcement on FE and BE. | Pending | AC-ORGANIZATION-11. |
| HR-ORG-004 | i18n | Review `en`, `ja`, `vi` wording and normalized keys. | Pending | Avoid typo/case mismatch. |
| HR-ORG-005 | Release/Rollback | Review migration rollout/rollback limitation. | Pending | No destructive rollback. |
