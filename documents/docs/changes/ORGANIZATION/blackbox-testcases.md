| Priority | P1 |
| Category | Deleted data / Permission |
| Preconditions | ADMIN user is logged in. Soft-deleted Organization exists and is visible through Deleted filter. |
| Input | Open deleted Organization detail. |
| Steps | 1. Select Deleted filter. 2. Open deleted Organization detail. 3. Check whether edit/save/delete controls are available. |
| Expected Result | Detail is viewable but read-only. Edit/save controls are disabled or hidden. User cannot update the deleted Organization. |
| Note | If direct API update is attempted for deleted record, it should be rejected according to validation/error behavior. |

### BB-ORG-027: Authenticated non-ADMIN opening Organization screen is logged out and redirected

| item | content |
|---|---|
| Related AC | AC-ORGANIZATION-11 |
| Priority | P0 |

| Input | Open Organization Management URL directly as non-ADMIN. |
| Steps | 1. Login as non-ADMIN. 2. Enter Organization Management URL directly. |
| Expected Result | FE logs out the user and redirects to `/:lang/login`, preserving current language when possible. Organization data is not displayed. |
| Note | Real provider-backed login can be replaced by an approved test session in automated E2E. |

### BB-ORG-028: Authenticated non-ADMIN direct API call returns 403

| item | content |
|---|---|
| Related AC | AC-ORGANIZATION-11 |
| Priority | P0 |
| Category | Permission |
| Preconditions | Authenticated non-ADMIN user/session exists. |
| Input | Direct calls to Organization list/detail/create/update/delete APIs. |
| Steps | 1. Call Organization API as non-ADMIN. 2. Repeat for read and write endpoints if available. |
| Expected Result | BE returns `403 Forbidden` with permission-denied message key such as `Component.Permission.Denied`. No Organization data is returned and no write occurs. |
| Note | This must hold even if FE route guard is bypassed. |

### BB-ORG-029: Unauthenticated Organization API call returns 401 or existing unauthenticated response

| item | content |
|---|---|
| Related AC | AC-ORGANIZATION-11 |
| Priority | P0 |
| Category | Permission |
| Preconditions | No valid authenticated session/cookie/token is present. |
| Input | Direct calls to Organization APIs. |
| Steps | 1. Clear authentication. 2. Call Organization list/detail/create/update/delete APIs. |
| Expected Result | Request is rejected by existing authentication behavior, normally `401 Unauthorized`. No Organization data is returned and no write occurs. |
| Note | No Organization-specific unauthenticated override is required unless project contract defines one. |

### BB-ORG-030: Existing traceId/error logging behavior remains observable on Organization API error

| item | content |
|---|---|
| Related AC | AC-ORGANIZATION-12 |
| Priority | P2 |
| Category | Operation / Log |
| Preconditions | Test environment can trigger an Organization API error safely, for example validation error, not-found, duplicate, or conflict. Existing global error response behavior is known. |
| Input | Invalid or conflicting Organization request. |
| Steps | 1. Trigger a controlled Organization API error. 2. Inspect response and application log/trace output if available to tester. |
| Expected Result | Existing error response shape and traceId/error logging behavior are not broken. User-facing response does not expose secrets or stack traces. |
| Note | Dedicated audit-log storage is not part of this release. |

### BB-ORG-031: Dedicated audit-log storage is not expected for this release

| item | content |
|---|---|
| Related AC | AC-ORGANIZATION-12 |
| Priority | P2 |
| Category | Operation / Audit |
| Preconditions | QA/reviewer has access to release scope and expected audit behavior. |
| Input | Create, update, and soft-delete Organization. |
| Steps | 1. Execute one successful create. 2. Execute one successful update. 3. Execute one successful soft delete. 4. Check release expectation for dedicated audit-log storage. |
| Expected Result | No failure is raised for absence of dedicated audit-log records because dedicated audit log is out of scope. Existing trace/error behavior remains intact. |
| Note | This prevents false failure from expecting a feature explicitly excluded by spec. |

| Preconditions | ADMIN user is logged in. Unique create/update input is prepared. |
| Input | Rapid double click on Save or two near-simultaneous identical API submissions. |
| Steps | 1. Open create or edit form. 2. Submit twice rapidly. 3. Check resulting list/detail and response/errors. |
| Expected Result | At most one successful create/update is applied. Duplicate active code/name is not created. If one request fails, it returns a safe duplicate/conflict/validation response. |
| Note | DB unique constraint race protection is implementation-level; black-box expected result is no duplicate active data. |

### BB-ORG-033: Reload/back navigation preserves safe list behavior without unauthorized data exposure

| item | content |
|---|---|
| Related AC | AC-ORGANIZATION-1, AC-ORGANIZATION-2, AC-ORGANIZATION-3 |

## Out of Scope / Not Covered by Black-box Cases

| area | reason | follow-up |
|---|---|---|
| External IF failure | Organization management does not require GitHub/Jira/CircleCI calls per current spec. | Cover in connector/webhook tickets. |
| Timeout/retry | No explicit retry/timeout requirement is defined for Organization CRUD. | Add if operation SLA or retry UX is specified. |
| Dedicated audit-log persistence | Explicitly out of scope by AC-ORGANIZATION-12. | Cover in a future audit-log ticket if introduced. |
| Child Customer/Project cascade-soft-delete flows | Covered by Organization soft delete behavior. | Verify child rows move to deleted/inactive state together with the Organization. |
