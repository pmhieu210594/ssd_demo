## 1. Execution Environment

| item | value |
|---|---|
| Environment | Local backend workspace |
| Backend version / commit | Git commit not captured in this run |
| Database | Test fixtures / no external database dependency in this run |
| GitHub Actions test source | Maven test suite under `src/test` |
| Test date | 2026-06-18 |

## 2. Executed Command

| command | result | log/evidence | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| `mvn test -q` | PASS | Maven exited with code `0`; output showed `GithubWebhookControllerTest`, `GithubWorkflowJobWebhookServiceTest`, `ArtifactScannerServiceTest`, and `SecurityEvidenceIngestService` logs | First sandboxed run was blocked by Maven Central access, then rerun with network permission succeeded |

## 3. Summary of Results

Backend Maven tests completed successfully.

The run verified the CI Run Metadata implementation path through the existing backend test suite. No failing tests remained in this execution.

## 4. List of Passes

| test | result | note |
|---|---|---|
| Backend Maven test suite | PASS | `mvn test -q` completed successfully |
| GitHub webhook controller tests | PASS | `GithubWebhookControllerTest` executed successfully |
| GitHub workflow job ingestion tests | PASS | `GithubWorkflowJobWebhookServiceTest` executed successfully |
| Security evidence ingestion tests | PASS | `SecurityEvidenceIngestService` tests executed successfully |

## 5. List of Fails

| test | cause | action | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| None in this run | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## 6. Bugs Fixed

| bug | fix | evidence |
|---|---|---|
| None in this test run | No code changes were needed for execution | `mvn test -q` passed |

## 7. Not yet fixed / Pending

| item | reason | impact |
|---|---|---|
| Live GitHub webhook delivery | External service access is not available in this local run | Runtime delivery behavior remains covered by unit/integration tests rather than a live GitHub callback |

## 8. Test cannot be executed and reason

| test/command | reason | risk | alternative evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| Live GitHub webhook delivery | Requires external GitHub access and a valid webhook endpoint | Could differ from local test fixture behavior | Existing backend tests and logged webhook handler output |

## 9. Remaining risk

- Live external webhook delivery was not exercised in this environment.
- Backend test evidence is local-only and depends on the current test fixtures.
- No commit hash was recorded in this test log.

## 10. Final Test Verdict

- PASS
