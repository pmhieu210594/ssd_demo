**Ticket ID**: CI-RUN-METADATA  
**Create date**: 2026-06-17  
**Author**: ChatGPT  
**Update date**: 2026-06-17  

## 1. Context / Purpose

The SDD Evidence MVP needs CI evidence to support traceability from ticket and PR to CI execution.

This ticket defines the minimum CI metadata collector for GitHub Actions. The collector stores job-level CI metadata so that PM, QA, Developer, and Data Ops users can confirm whether CI ran, which job ran, what the result was, when it ran, and where to open the original GitHub Actions evidence.

This ticket is metadata-first. It does not collect raw CI logs, full artifacts, raw command output, or sensitive data.

## 2. Scope

### 2.1. Within range

- Collect GitHub Actions job-level metadata.
- Persist one row per GitHub Actions job into `tbl_fact_ci_run`.
- Store workflow run ID as `external_run_id`.
- Store job ID as `external_job_id`.
- Store workflow name, job name, status, started time, completed time, and CI URL.
- Link CI job to repository.
- Link CI job to PR when PR metadata is available.
- Link CI job to ticket when ticket ID can be inferred.
- Record collector execution in `tbl_connector_run`.
- Expose stored metadata for dashboard and ticket evidence detail.

### 2.2. Out of range

- Raw CI log storage.
- Full CI artifact storage.
- Test result parsing.
- Coverage parsing.
- Failure category classification.
- Flaky test detection.
- Secret / SAST / SCA summary collection.
- Security finding detail.
- Re-run button or manual refresh button.
- High-risk human approval.
- Using `_ticket-template` as runtime CI evidence.

## 3. Terminology

| terms | meaning | notes |
|---|---|---|
| GitHub Actions | CI/CD provider used as source of truth for CI metadata. | Provider for this MVP. |
| Workflow | A GitHub Actions workflow definition, for example `CI` or `Security Evidence Scan`. | Usually defined by YAML under `.github/workflows/`. |
| Workflow run | One execution of a workflow. | Stored as `external_run_id`. |
| Job | A unit of work inside a workflow run. | This ticket stores one row per job. |
| Job URL | GitHub URL that opens a specific job. | Preferred value for `ci_url`. |
| Workflow run URL | GitHub URL that opens a workflow run. | Fallback value for `ci_url`. |
| CI status | Normalized result/status stored in DB. | `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, `CANCELLED`, `SKIPPED`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `QUEUED`, `UNKNOWN`. |
| Idempotency | Re-running the collector must not create duplicate rows. | Enforced by unique key. |

## 4. As-Is

- CI results exist in GitHub Actions.
- Users may need to manually open GitHub Actions to check CI status and job details.
- Traceability from Ticket / PR to CI job is not guaranteed in the evidence platform.
- CI job URL is not consistently available in the dashboard or ticket evidence detail.
- There is a risk that an API response reports handled data while actual DB insert/update did not happen unless ingest counters and idempotency are explicit.

## 5. To-Be

- The system collects GitHub Actions job metadata and stores it in `tbl_fact_ci_run`.
- Each GitHub Actions job is represented by one DB row.
- Users can see workflow name, job name, status, started/completed time, and URL from dashboard or ticket evidence detail.
- Re-running the collector updates existing job rows instead of creating duplicates.
- Raw logs and sensitive content are never persisted.

## 6. Detailed specification

### 6.6. Non-functional

| item | requirement | target / threshold | verification | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Performance | Collector should handle MVP repository scale. | 1-2 repos, recent workflow runs/jobs. | Integration test. | No real-time requirement in Phase 1. |
| Security | Do not store raw logs, artifacts, secrets, tokens, private keys, raw command output. | 0 forbidden persistence. | Security checklist and code review. | Metadata only. |
| Availability / Reliability | Collector failure must be visible. | `tbl_connector_run` contains failure status/error. | Integration test. | No silent failure. |
| Maintainability | Status mapping and provider mapping should be isolated. | Mapper unit testable. | Unit tests. | GitHub-only in MVP. |
| Observability / Logging | Collector records received/inserted/updated/skipped/error counts. | All runs tracked. | Connector run log validation. | Prevent misleading `handled` responses. |
| Compatibility | Use only approved `tbl_` tables. | No non-`tbl_` tables. | DB review. | Matches project convention. |

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

## 8. Examples

### 8.1. Normal Case

A workflow run has two jobs.

```text
Workflow: CI
Workflow Run ID: 27660577827
Job 1: build, Job ID: 77123456789, Status: SUCCESS
Job 2: test, Job ID: 77123456790, Status: SUCCESS
```

Expected result:

- Two rows are stored in `tbl_fact_ci_run`.
- Both rows have the same `external_run_id`.
- Each row has a different `external_job_id`.
- Each row has a job-specific `ci_url` if available.

### 8.2. Error Case

GitHub Actions API authentication fails.

Expected result:

- No orphan CI job rows are inserted.
- `tbl_connector_run` records failure status.
- Error message indicates authentication failure without exposing token value.

### 8.3. Boundary Case

A GitHub Actions job is still running.

Expected result:

- The job row is stored with status `IN_PROGRESS` or `QUEUED`.
- `completed_at` is null.
- `ci_url` is stored if available.
- A later collector run updates the same row when the job completes.

## 9. Source Availability Summary

| source area | availability | decision |
|---|---|---|
| Ticket requirement | Available | Use as primary functional source. |
| User decision on data grain | Available | Use job-level grain. |
| Documentation templates | Available | Use template structure. |
| GitHub Actions API details | Partially available | Need authentication and exact API usage confirmation. |
| Existing DB schema | Unknown | Must confirm before implementation. |
| Existing backend source | Unknown | Inspect during implementation phase. |

## 10. Complexity Classification

```text
- Complexity: Standard
- System shape: BE + DB + Batch/Connector + Dashboard API
- Primary risk: Source / Contract / Operation / Test
- Review mode: Standard
- Required options: Source Analysis / FE-BE Contract / DB Migration
```

Rationale:

- The feature is not algorithmically complex.
- It requires external API integration, DB idempotency, status normalization, and traceability linkage.
- The main implementation risks are API authentication, schema compatibility, and avoiding duplicate rows.

## 11. FE/BE Contract Impact

Expected BE output for dashboard / ticket evidence detail:

| field | description |
|---|---|
| `externalRunId` | GitHub Actions workflow run ID. |
| `externalJobId` | GitHub Actions job ID. |
| `workflowName` | Workflow name. |
| `jobName` | Job name. |
| `status` | Normalized CI job status. |
| `startedAt` | Job start time. |
| `completedAt` | Job completion time; nullable. |
| `ciUrl` | Job URL or workflow run URL fallback. |

UI should avoid implying that workflow run and job are the same thing. Displaying both `workflowName` and `jobName` is required.

## 12. DB/Migration Impact

Expected table:

- `tbl_fact_ci_run`

Expected key design:

```text
Unique key = ci_provider + repository_id + external_run_id + external_job_id
```

Expected required columns:

- `ci_run_id`
- `project_id`
- `repository_id`
- `ci_provider`
- `external_run_id`
- `external_job_id`
- `workflow_name`
- `job_name`
- `status`
- `ci_url`

Nullable columns:

- `ticket_id`
- `pull_request_id`
- `connector_run_id`
- `started_at`
- `completed_at`

Migration must not introduce non-`tbl_` tables.

## 13. Security/Privacy Impact

Security/privacy rule:

- Do not store raw CI logs.
- Do not store full CI artifacts.
- Do not store raw command output.
- Do not store secret values.
- Do not store tokens.
- Do not store private keys.
- Do not log authentication credentials.

The stored URL is a reference to GitHub Actions source of truth. Access control to the URL is handled by GitHub permissions, but the application should still enforce its own project/repository authorization before showing the URL.

## 14. Operation/Maintenance Impact

- Data Ops needs connector run visibility.
- Each collector execution should record status and counters in `tbl_connector_run`.
- Important counters:
  - records received
  - records inserted
  - records updated
  - records skipped
  - error count
- Failures should not look successful just because input payload was handled.
- Re-running the collector must be safe due to idempotent persistence.

## 15. Test Strategy Summary

| test type | target |
|---|---|
| Unit test | Status normalization from GitHub status/conclusion to MVP enum. |
| Unit test | URL selection: job URL preferred, workflow run URL fallback. |
| Unit test | Idempotency key generation. |
| Integration test | Collector -> DB insert for multiple jobs in one workflow run. |
| Integration test | Re-running collector updates existing rows and does not duplicate. |
| Integration test | Repository unresolved case logs error and skips row. |
| Security test/checklist | Confirm forbidden raw data is not persisted. |
| UI/API test | Ticket evidence detail displays workflow/job/status/time/URL. |

## 16. Human Decision Required

| ID | decision item | reasons | owner | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| H-CI-RUN-METADATA-1 | Confirm GitHub Actions authentication method. | Required before implementation. | Admin / Backend lead | Open |
| H-CI-RUN-METADATA-2 | Confirm exact existing DB schema and migration tool. | Prevent schema conflict. | DB owner / Backend lead | Open |
| H-CI-RUN-METADATA-3 | Confirm ticket ID matching rule. | Needed for ticket linkage. | PM / Backend lead | Open |
| H-CI-RUN-METADATA-4 | Confirm dashboard default display: all jobs, failed jobs, or latest jobs. | UI behavior. | PM / UX | Open |

## 17. Assumptions and Inference Log

| ID | assumption | basis | risk | need confirmation? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A-CI-RUN-METADATA-1 | GitHub Actions is the CI/CD provider. | User discussion and existing MVP direction. | Low | Yes |
| A-CI-RUN-METADATA-2 | GitHub Actions job ID is available to the backend collector. | Job-level data grain decision. | Medium | Yes |
| A-CI-RUN-METADATA-3 | Existing `tbl_fact_ci_run` may be adapted to job-level grain. | Approved table set includes `tbl_fact_ci_run`. | Medium | Yes |
| A-CI-RUN-METADATA-4 | Job URL can be stored as `ci_url`, with workflow run URL fallback. | User clarification and GitHub Actions model. | Low | Yes |
| A-CI-RUN-METADATA-5 | PR/ticket linkage can be nullable for MVP. | Traceability can be improved incrementally. | Low | Yes |

## 18. Open Issues

| ID | issue | impact | owner | status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| OI-CI-RUN-METADATA-1 | GitHub Actions authentication method is not confirmed. | Blocks connector implementation. | Admin / Backend lead | Open |
| OI-CI-RUN-METADATA-2 | Existing DB schema is not confirmed. | Blocks final migration design. | DB owner | Open |
| OI-CI-RUN-METADATA-3 | Ticket ID matching rule is not confirmed. | Ticket linkage may be incomplete. | PM / Backend lead | Open |
| OI-CI-RUN-METADATA-4 | Dashboard default filter is not confirmed. | UI may need adjustment. | PM / UX | Open |

## 19. Phase 1 Output Judgment

### 19.1. Can this ticket move to Phase 3 using only this Spec Pack?

**Judgment: CONDITIONAL_GO**

The specification is clear enough to design the data model and implementation approach for the CI job metadata collector. However, implementation must not start until the blocking human decisions are confirmed.

### 19.2. Missing information

- GitHub Actions authentication method.
- Existing DB schema and migration tool.
- Exact ticket ID matching rule.
- Existing backend connector/service/repository conventions.

### 19.3. Questions for human confirmation

1. Which GitHub authentication method should the collector use?
2. Is the collection mode batch, webhook, or internal API push?
3. Is `tbl_fact_ci_run` already present, and can `external_job_id` be required?
4. What is the official ticket ID pattern?
5. Should dashboard show all jobs, only failed jobs, or latest jobs by default?

### 19.4. Required specialist packs

| pack | required? | reason |
|---|---|---|
| Source Analysis Pack | Yes | Need to inspect existing backend/DB patterns. |
| FE-BE Contract Pack | Yes | Dashboard and ticket detail output need API contract. |
| DB Migration Pack | Yes | Need schema/migration validation. |
| Security Pack | Light | Confirm no raw logs/secrets are stored. |
| Test Pack | Yes | Unit/integration tests for collector and idempotency. |
